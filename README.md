##Election-Audit Summary
The Python code can easily be used for any elections without the need for additional code. The election commission may want to layer in more details to help tell a story. Additional Python code can be used to compare voter turnout to registered voters. Adding Python code to know what methods votes are being cast thought electronic booth, paper ballot, drop off or mail and where could help to determine future staffing and volunteer needs.
